# SPEEDFIX-Graduation-Project
The auto repair industry is undergoing a digital transformation, and SPEEDFIX aims to modernize the process by connecting car owners with repair workshops through an intuitive online platform. Traditional repair management often suffers from inefficiency and poor coordination — SPEEDFIX solves these issues with intelligent automation and user-friendly design.

The system leverages AI-powered damage detection using a VGG16 machine learning model to analyze uploaded car images and identify damage types accurately. Users can then compare repair prices from multiple workshops and book appointments easily through the platform.

Built with Flutter for the front end, FastAPI for backend services, and SQLAlchemy for efficient database management, SPEEDFIX delivers a seamless experience from analysis to payment.

Initial trials demonstrate strong accuracy and reliability in the AI model, showcasing SPEEDFIX’s potential to significantly streamline and revolutionize the auto repair process.
